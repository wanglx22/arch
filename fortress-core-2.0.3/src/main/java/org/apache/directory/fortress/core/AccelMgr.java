/**
 * This object performs runtime access control operations on objects that are provisioned RBAC entities
 * that reside in LDAP directory.  These APIs map directly to similar named APIs specified by ANSI and NIST
 * RBAC system functions.
 * Many of the java doc function descriptions found below were taken directly from ANSI INCITS 359-2004.
 * The RBAC Functional specification describes administrative operations for the creation
 * and maintenance of RBAC element sets and relations; administrative review functions for
 * performing administrative queries; and system functions for creating and managing
 * RBAC attributes on user sessions and making access control decisions.
 * <h3></h3>
 * <h4>RBAC0 - Core</h4>
 * Many-to-many relationship between Users, Roles and Permissions. Selective role activation into sessions.  API to add, 
 * update, delete identity data and perform identity and access control decisions during runtime operations.
 * <p>
 * <img src="./doc-files/RbacCore.png" alt="Rbac Core">
 * <hr>
 * <h4>RBAC1 - General Hierarchical Roles</h4>
 * Simplifies role engineering tasks using inheritance of one or more parent roles.
 * <p>
 * <img src="./doc-files/RbacHier.png" alt="Rbac Hierarchy">
 * <hr>
 * <h4>RBAC2 - Static Separation of Duty (SSD) Relations</h4>
 * Enforce mutual membership exclusions across role assignments.  Facilitate dual control policies by restricting which 
 * roles may be assigned to users in combination.  SSD provide added granularity for authorization limits which help 
 * enterprises meet strict compliance regulations.
 * <p>
 * <img src="./doc-files/RbacSSD.png" alt="Rbac SSD">
 * <hr>
 * <h4>RBAC3 - Dynamic Separation of Duty (DSD) Relations</h4>
 * Control allowed role combinations to be activated within an RBAC session.  DSD policies fine tune role policies that 
 * facilitate authorization dual control and two man policy restrictions during runtime security checks.
 * <p>
