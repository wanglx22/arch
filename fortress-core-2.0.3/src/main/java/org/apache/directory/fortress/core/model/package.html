<p>
    The data entities in this package comprise the fortress data model. These classes are intended to be accessible
    publicly using the getter and setters methods on them.
    All entities ({@link User}, {@link Role}, {@link Permission},
    {@link PwPolicy} {@link SDSet} etc...) are used to carry data between three Fortress layers:
    (1) Manager layer - e.g. AdminMgrImpl, AccessMgrImpl, ReviewMgrImpl
    (2) Process layer - e.g. UserP, RoleP, PermP
    (3) DAO layer - e.g. UserDAO, RoleDAO, PermDAO
</p>
