/**
 * This interface prescribes the API for performing runtime delegated access control operations on objects that are 
 * provisioned Fortress ARBAC entities that reside in LDAP directory.
 * These APIs map directly to similar named APIs specified by ARBAC02 functions.  The ARBAC Functional specification 
 * describes delegated administrative operations for the creation and maintenance of ARBAC element sets and relations.  
 * Delegated administrative review functions for performing administrative queries and system functions for creating and 
 * managing ARBAC attributes on user sessions and making delegated administrative access control decisions.
 * <h3>Administrative Role Based Access Control (ARBAC)</h3>
 * <img src="./doc-files/ARbac.png" alt="">
 * <p>
 * Fortress fully supports the Oh/Sandhu/Zhang ARBAC02 model for delegated administration.  ARBAC provides large enterprises 
 * the capability to delegate administrative authority to users that reside outside of the security admin group.
 * Decentralizing administration helps because it provides security provisioning capability to work groups without 
 * sacrificing regulations for accountability or traceability.
 * <p>
 * This interface's implementer will NOT be thread safe if parent instance variables ({@link Manageable#setContextId(String)} 
 * or {@link Manageable#setAdmin(org.apache.directory.fortress.core.model.Session)}) are set.
